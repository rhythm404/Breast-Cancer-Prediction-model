# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-model
Breast cancer detection using 3 different models i.e. Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree Machine Learning models and optimizing them for even a better accuracy. This project is started with the goal use machine learning algorithms and learn how to optimize the tuning params and also and hopefully to help some diagnoses.
# Problem Statement
This project focuses in investigating the probability of predicting the chances of breast cancer from the given characteristics of breast mass computed from dataset. This project will examine the data available and attempt to predict the possibility that a breast cancer.
