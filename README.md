# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-model
Breast cancer detection using 3 different models i.e. Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Tree Machine Learning models and optimizing them for even a better accuracy. This project is started with the goal use machine learning algorithms and learn how to optimize the tuning params and also and hopefully to help some diagnoses.
